After years of struggling to maintan my old PHP and WordPress website, I have finally decided to cut my losses and move 
to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Regrettably, the same reasons that made 
maintaining content in WordPress difficult aldo made it hard to move it to the new system. I have moved some of the 
[T4 Toolbox](http://olegsych.com/T4Toolbox/) content that is still relevant to its new home on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/olegsych/T4Toolbox/tree/gh-pages). Although I have all of the old content saved, a lot of it
is missing from the new web site. Send me an issue or, even better, a pull request if you are want to bring some of it 
back.
